Project Synopsis

My game is a turn-based strategy game in a pixel-art style. The idea is that you‚Äôll build teams of characters, and then fight in turn-based battles. Except your characters are (almost) entirely random people, your resources are very limited, and every fight is brutally difficult. There will be back-to-back fights with no prep-time in between, bosses will be much stronger than anything else around them. There‚Äôs resources to make fights easier, but there‚Äôs a very limited amount of them in the whole game. If a character dies in a fight, there‚Äôs no healing them after, and you can‚Äôt use them anymore. If you lose a battle, you lose and go back to the beginning of the game.

## The World:

The world is an alternative universe to Earth. The only sport is bug fighting, where people train bugs to fight each other. Because of this, bugs have evolved to be very intelligent and have outlived every creature on Earth, except humans. They‚Äôve been able to develop technology to domesticate these bugs, and have adapted them to survive almost anything. Because of this, bugs are now used to fight each other for sport. People place bets on them, and there‚Äôs even bug fighting on a professional level. The best bug trainers in the world are delegated by countries to compete in an international event every year, hosted by the United Nations themselves.

Enter Huebert. He is a 15 year old kid who has loved bug fighting since he was 6\. And now that he‚Äôs finally old enough, he can own his own bugs to train and fight with. And he wants to become the best in the world. But first, he has to become a champion of his region, then the champion of the United States. Only then will he have a chance to become the best.

The protagonist‚Äôs name is Huebert. He is an average kid from New York City who wants to rise through the ranks of professional fighting to become the best in the world.

The main antagonists of the game are the city champions. In major cities across the entire country, there are fighters who have proven themselves as the best in their area. Beating certain city champions allows one to qualify for the regional tournaments. When someone wins 5 regionals, they can enter the national tournament for a chance to go to internationals.

The allies of Huebert are the bugs that he tames and trains along his journey to becoming the best in the world. Some are much, much stronger than others, but they‚Äôre all important in making it to the top.

## Target Audience & Inspiration

Teenagers to adults that like brutally difficult turn-based RPGs. There‚Äôs a lot of strategy and planning involved in the game.

Collecting trophies from each city and tournament win, as well as getting more bugs to fight with, and upgrades for those bugs.  
The game has about 100 hours of gameplay, and one mistake can send you back to the very beginning of the game. It‚Äôs designed to test a player‚Äôs patience and planning skills, as well as on-your-feet decision making.

Pokemon Run and Bun, Pokemon Renegade Platinum, and Skyrim

The turn-based combat and bug-catching aspects come from the Pokemon games, and the aspect of travelling all over the country is inspired by the exploration parts of Skyrim (the long journeys between objectives, and the things to do along the way).  
Any Pokemon game; Any (official) Pokemon game wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as difficult, and it wouldn‚Äôt send you back to the start if you lose a battle.

## Goals:

Frustration from difficult fights, but also joy from overcoming a challenge.

The idea of having very limited resources to train your bugs and to use in battle. Healing between some fights isn‚Äôt an option, so players will have to plan for some fights knowing that they might not be able to heal for quite some time. However, overcoming a difficult fight should feel great, and I hope to reward the player with valuable resources every time they beat a boss.
