# **User Story 1:**

As a player of difficult games, I want to feel frustrated, so that I can feel accomplished when I win a difficult fight

Acceptance Criteria 1: The user can do intensive planning

Acceptance Criteria 2: The game shows safe, turn-by-turn fights

# **User Story 2:**

As an experienced RPG player, I want a game that will have similar mechanics, so I can feel like I'm playing something I'm familiar with.

Acceptance Criteria 1: The player can do turn-based combat

Acceptance Criteria 2: The game will show boss fights with team synergies

# **User Story 3:**

As a player who's newer to RPGs, I want a game that will introduce me to the mechanics of RPGs so I know what to expect when I play more of them.

Acceptance Criteria 1: The player can follow clear and understandable instructions

Acceptance Criteria 2: The game will show some fights that are challenging but will ease players into the difficulty

# **Game Designer's Reflection:**

The first user story was definitely the easiest to write, as it was easy to write a user story for the type of person I want to play the game.

The hardest was the third one, as it feels about as far as I can go from the type of player I hope enjoys the game.

I'll definitely keep the third type of player in mind, but I would like to focus much more on catering to more experienced players who want a challenge.
